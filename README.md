I build virtual worlds! 

I love exploring how technology, cognition, and design shape both our reality and our existence. I've always been interested in games, game engine development, the space between technical art and computer graphics (frameworks, shaders, rendering, and 3D modelling/texturing).

At the moment, I'm a part-time software developer on a research project using GIS‚Äêenabled historiography to reconstruct and analyze historical travel routes to identify where Attila the Hun (yes, that [Attila the Hun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attila)) might have been buried.
