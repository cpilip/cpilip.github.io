# > about

Hey there! I'm Christina. 

I build virtual worlds and atmospheres, and am always looking to widen my horizons. Learning how the world works — and how it shapes us as well as our existence and perceptions of reality — is the foundation for everything.

I've always been interested in game and game engine development, as well as the gradient between technical art and computer graphics (frameworks, shaders, rendering, and 3D modelling/texturing).

Otherwise, I'm into technology, cognitive science, visuo-spatial design in digital media, and posthuman narratives. I also run my own D&D campaign.

# > current activity

I'm currently working as a software developer on a research project using GIS‐enabled historiography to reconstruct and analyze historical travel routes to identify where Attila the Hun (yes, that [Attila the Hun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attila)) might have been buried.

The project is in the data processing and cleaning stage of development; eventually, the reconstructed route network and burial site predictions will be presented as an online, interactive map and simulation using Unreal Engine 5. It's a neat intersection between several very different worlds — past, present, and future!
